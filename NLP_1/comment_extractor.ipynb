I hope so !Welcome to the first episode of my series of English teaching videosbefore I Begin , we will take a look at some of the common questions .that often arise when taken about learning the english language .and more importantly , when learning it as a Second Langauge .So, The First Question must be .Why do we need learn English ?\\xa0of Course one of the reasons why we need to be able to speek english nowadayes is becouse the world is becoming smaller .thanks to the internet and our developing global economy ,more and more people are using English as a common way to communicate with each other .So now it has become unavoidable that companies and large businesses .Will need employ people who can speak more than their own native langauge .that is where english comes in .it is now widely considered as an international language .Of Course learning anything is difficult and english is no exception .however , there are ways to make the situation easier .I have come up with my own list of general rules for learning English .do you want to hear them ? do you want to know what they are ?okay, let&#39;s take a look at them,one by one !learning english takes time and patience.it cannot be rushed.try to relax and take it easy .the most important things you need at the begining is a good vocabulary.\\xa0for without words.you have nothing to work with you must view english as a part of your body ....just as you would an arm or a leg .it must become a part of your everday life.daily practise is very important.you must start with a strong foundation or base and slowly build on it . day by day!do not look at english as just another subject your attitude to english and the way you view it well decide how well you progress.just as we say in english&quot; no pain , no gain&quot;do not worry about making mistakes.in fact the more mistakes you make, the more you will learn from them ,just like learning to ride a bike,sometimes you fall off, so what do you do ?you get back on and try again.the two most important words to remember when learning english are ..Practise and confidence .Practise english every day and be confidence .you will find that the more you use english ,\\xa0the better your english will become andthe more confident you become ,then the more you will want to use it .make it a rule to tell yourself....I can do It ...please remember , my lessons are aimed at everyone.Even teachers are very welcome to join in .Learning English should be a fun experience and I hope with the help of my video lessonsyou will discover just how much fun it can be.I hope you&#39;ve enjoed my first lesson and that is has been useful to you .This is Misterduncan in England saying thanks for watching me, introducing myself....to youand until next time ....ta-ta for now.',\n",
